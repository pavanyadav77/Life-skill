## 5. My Actions to Build Growth Mindset

After watching these videos, I realised that mindset plays a big role in how I approach learning and problems. Many times, when I get stuck while coding, I tend to doubt myself instead of the process. I want to change that.

I will try to focus more on effort than immediate results. If something does not work, I will treat it as feedback rather than failure. I will make it a habit to ask questions and clarify doubts instead of staying silent.

I also want to improve how I handle feedback. Instead of taking it personally, I will use it to improve my work. Most importantly, I will try to stay consistent even on days when motivation is low, because real growth comes from sustained effort.
