# Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace (PoSH)

## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment is any unwelcome behaviour of a sexual nature that makes a person uncomfortable or embarrassed. It doesn't matter what the person *intended* to do; what matters is the impact on the person receiving it.

Here are specific examples of bad behaviour:

* **Physical Behaviour:**
    * Unwelcome touching, pinching, patting, or stroking.
    * Kissing, hugging, or fondling.
    * Brushing against someone's body.
    * Blocking movement or forced physical contact.
* **Verbal Behaviour:**
    * Making sexual comments or gestures.
    * Telling "dirty" jokes or using sexually oriented language.
    * Asking personal or unwarranted questions about someone's sex life or dating.
    * Comments about a person's appearance, body, or clothing.
    * Repeatedly asking a co-worker out for a date after they have already said no.
    * Spreading rumours about a person's personal or sexual life.
* **Visual/Digital Behaviour:**
    * Displaying sexually explicit pictures, posters, cartoons, or calendars.
    * Sending offensive emails, text messages, or voicemails.
    * staring at someone's body.
* **Other Behaviour:**
    * Gender-based insults or sexist remarks.
    * Giving extra work, refusing to promote, or treating someone differently just because of their gender.

## 2. What to do if you face or witness sexual harassment?

If you experience or witness any of these behaviours, it is important to take action to stop them.

* **Tell the Person to Stop:** If you feel safe doing so, tell the person directly that their behaviour is unwelcome and ask them to stop immediately.
* **Keep Records:** Write down every incident in detail. Include dates, times, locations, what happened, and if there were any witnesses.
* **Report the Incident:** If the behaviour continues, or if you do not feel comfortable talking to the person directly, report it.
    * Report the incident in writing to the **Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)**.
    * You can also tell your supervisor or a manager.
    * If the supervisor is the harasser, report it to their boss or HR.
* **Retaliation is Illegal:** The company cannot retaliate against you for making a complaint.
