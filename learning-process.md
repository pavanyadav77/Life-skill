## 4. Reflection on Learning Principles

**Question 5: What actions can you take to improve your learning process?**

From now on, I want to focus fully when I study and avoid multitasking. I will keep my phone on silent and remove unnecessary notifications. I plan to work in focused time blocks and take short breaks in between. While learning software concepts, I will try to understand where they are used and explain them in my own words. I will practice writing code regularly instead of only reading. I will take notes during discussions and revise them later. I will also track my time and set realistic deadlines to stay consistent. Most importantly, I want to enjoy the learning process and stay curious rather than feeling stressed.
