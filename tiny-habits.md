# Tiny Habits and Habit Building

## 1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg

**Question 1: What was the most interesting idea for you?**

The most interesting idea for me was that we should not wait for motivation. Most days, motivation is low. Instead, if we start with something very small, it becomes easier to continue. This idea felt very practical to me.

## 2. B = MAP Model

**Question 2: How can you use B = MAP? What are M, A and P?**

B = MAP means behaviour happens when three things come together.

- M means Motivation  
- A means Ability  
- P means Prompt  

I understood that instead of forcing myself, I should make the habit easy. If the habit is simple and there is a clear reminder, it will happen even when motivation is low.

**Question 3: Why is it important to celebrate (“Shine”)?**

Celebrating is important because it creates a good feeling. When I feel happy after doing a good thing, my brain remembers it. Even a small celebration helps the habit repeat again. This idea felt strange at first, but it makes sense.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day

**Question 4: Most interesting idea**

The idea that a small improvement every day is enough was very helpful. Earlier, I thought progress must be fast. This video showed that even slow progress is okay if it is consistent.

## 4. Atomic Habits – Book Summary

**Question 5: What is the book’s perspective about Identity?**

The book says habits are linked to identity. Instead of saying “I want to do this”, we should think “this is who I am becoming”. When identity changes, habits change naturally.

**Question 6: How to make a habit easier to do?**

Good habits become easier to follow when they are clear, simple, and enjoyable. If something feels too hard or boring, we naturally avoid it. Starting with small and manageable steps makes it much easier to stay consistent.

**Question 7: How to make a habit harder to do?**

To reduce bad habits, we should hide triggers and make the habit difficult. Changing the environment is more effective.

## 5. Reflection

**Question 8: One habit I want to do more**

I want to practice coding daily. I will start small with 20 minutes. I will keep my laptop ready, so I don’t delay. After finishing, I will tick it off so I feel satisfied.

**Question 9: One habit I want to reduce**

I want to reduce phone usage. I often scroll without thinking. To fix this, I will keep my phone away while studying and remove apps from the home screen.
